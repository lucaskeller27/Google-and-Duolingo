Tela de Login | Google & Duolingo
====================================

Constru√ß√£o de telas de login do Google & Duolingo.

## ‚öôÔ∏è O Projeto

- Desenvolvi o projeto em React Native, no site Expo.dev. 
- Abaixo, detalhei algumas etapas de configura√ß√£o dos dois projetos, e depois, abordei separadamente as etapas para constru√ß√£o de cada tela.

## üöÄ Passo a Passo

- Primeiramente, eu importei do React Native os aspectos e fun√ß√µes que eu utilizei, como `<Text>`, e `<View>`.
- Depois, eu

Launch the application with:

    $ mvn spring-boot:run

Or use  instead of `mvn` (`mvnw.cmd` for Window platforms).

Then access the application with http://localhost:8080/, or access
to the API with http://localhost:8080/api/.

One of the users to access the app with privileged permissions is `frodo@local`,
and the password `admin`. Check and edit the initial dataset in
the [DatabaseLoader.java](src/main/java/ar/com/mrdev/app/user/DatabaseLoader.java#L46-L50)
file.

If you access the API through the HAL browser, it will require to sign-in
like with the dash panel using a web page provided by Spring Security,
but if you are going to consume the API with a 3rd party tool
you will need to authenticate using
[HTTP Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication),
eg. with `curl` the `Authorization: Basic ...` header can be generated using
the `-u user:pass` argument:

    $ curl -u gf@local:admin http://localhost:8080/api/users

#### üå∂ Hot reloading

To edit Javascript or CSS resources and see the changes in the
browser without the need to re-launch the application, execute within
a command line:

    $ npm run watch

And leave it running (if it doesn't work, try with `target/node/npm run watch`).


#### üì¶ Packaging

Pack the application in a single .jar with all the dependencies
and the web server with:

    $ mvn package

Add the argument `-Dmaven.test.skip` if you don't want to run the tests before packaging.

Then you can run the .jar with:

    $ java -jar target/app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


### ‚èØ Tests

For now only a test that checks that the spring context
can be loaded is in the source code. Execute with:

    $ mvn test

A _GitHub Action_ workflow is configured as well
as **CI** environment, check out [maven.yml](.github/workflows/maven.yml).

Versions
--------

For now there are two versions, each one with its own branch:

- `master`: main version with an in-memory database (H2) to quickly
  launch the application without the need of a database installed (local tests).
- `postgres`: modified version with PostgreSQL configured,
  ready for "production" usage.

**Source code**: https://github.com/mrsarm/spring-react-crud

**Authors**:
* Mariano Ruiz <mrsarm (at) gmail>

The goal was to learn React and using Spring as backend, so I started
following this [guide](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest)
from _Spring.io_ (Greg Turnquist and other authors from _Pivotal_), but I ended up
rewriting  almost all from scratch and adding a lot of features, like Bootstrap,
client side validations, routing, updating dependencies to major versions ...
